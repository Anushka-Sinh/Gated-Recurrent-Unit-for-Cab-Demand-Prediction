## 🚕 Cab Demand Prediction
### 📋 Overview 

This project aims to predict cab demand in different locations at various times using historical data. Accurate demand forecasting helps cab companies optimize fleet allocation, reduce wait times for passengers, and increase operational efficiency.

Using machine learning models, the system processes data such as time of day, location and historical demand patterns to forecast future demand with high accuracy.

### 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models

Algorithms Used: GRU, XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear and Ridge Regression 

Time series Analysis: To analysis the data over the different time line(hourly, Day, Week, month)

Geospatial: 

### [🔗 🗂️Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
Data is collected from official database website of NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) 

The project will require a dataset containing historical cab ride data, including:

Timestamp: The specific time and date of the ride.
Pickup Location: The geographic coordinates of the pickup location.
Dropoff Location: The geographic coordinates of the dropoff location.
Passenger Count: The number of passengers in the ride.
Fare: The total fare charged for the ride.
Distance: Distance covered 
Additional Charges: Total charges over original fare
